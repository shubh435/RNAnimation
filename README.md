## 🧩 How It Works

The carousel animation uses:

### ✔️ `useSharedValue`

To keep animated states in sync.

### ✔️ `interpolate` / `useAnimatedStyle`

To animate scaling & opacity of cards while scrolling.

### ✔️ `PanGestureHandler`

To detect swipe gesture and trigger snapping behavior.

If you need an "Animation Logic" section with code comments, I can generate that too.
